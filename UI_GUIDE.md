## Introduction
This guide is designed for beginners who want to create User Interfaces (UI) in PlayCanvas. It will walk you through the key concepts and tools you need to know to get started.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project
1. Create a new project in PlayCanvas.
2. Navigate to the **Editor** and find the **Asset Panel** on the left side.
3. Click on the **Add Asset** button to upload any images or assets you want to use in your UI.

## Step 2: Creating a New UI Element
1. In the **Hierarchy Panel**, right-click and select **Add New** -> **Element**.
2. A new element will appear in the hierarchy. You can rename it as necessary (e.g., "Button", "Panel").
3. Select the newly created element and go to the **Inspector Panel** to configure it.

## Step 3: Customizing UI Element Properties
1. With the UI Element selected, you can adjust properties such as:
   - **Position**: Set the X, Y, Z coordinates to place your UI element.
   - **Size**: Change the width and height of your element.
   - **Color**: Pick a color using the color picker.

## Step 4: Adding Text to Your UI

2. Select the text element and update the text in the Inspector Panel.
3. Customize the font, size, and alignment as needed.

## Step 5: Adding Interactivity 
1. To make your UI interactive (like buttons), you’ll need to add a script.
2. Create a new script in your project and attach it to your UI element in the Inspector Panel.
3. In your script, you can use event listeners to handle user interactions, for example, click events.

## Step 6: Preview and Test Your UI 
1. Click on the **Play** button at the top of the editor to enter Play mode.
2. Test the functionality of your UI elements and adjust as needed.
3. Make sure that all interactive elements work as intended.
