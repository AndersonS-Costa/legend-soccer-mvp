# Development Guidelines

## Coding Standards
- Follow the latest ECMAScript standards.
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces) and avoid tabs.
- Write comments for complex code blocks and key functionalities.
- Keep functions and classes short and focused.

## PlayCanvas Conventions
- Utilize PlayCanvas built-in features effectively.
- Maintain a clean entity hierarchy.
- Use the script attached to the appropriate entities for better organization.
- Use PlayCanvas’ built-in scripting console for debugging.

## Script Organization
- Group related scripts into folders based on functionality (e.g., UI, Gameplay, Inputs).
- Use descriptive names for script files that reflect their purpose.
- Document each script with a brief summary of its function at the top.

## Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `playerScore`, `initializeGame`).
- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `PlayerController`, `GameManager`).
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants (e.g., `MAX_PLAYERS`, `GAME_STATE`).

## Commit Messages
- Write clear and concise messages for each commit.
- Use the format: `Type: Description` (e.g., `Feature: Add player scoring system`).

- Link to PlayCanvas documentation for reference.
- Recommended best practices for JavaScript and PlayCanvas.
